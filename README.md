# FDvsUD classification

FDvsUD_classification.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook for classifying high-dimensional data into binary categories.
Specifically, this notebook was designed to classify the output of the software [HCTSA](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa/) (created by B.D. Fulcher and N.S. Jones) run on excerpts (motifs) of songs by male Bengalese finches. The goal of the classification task was to  discriminate Female-Directed (FD) from Un-Directed (UD) songs based on vocal features alone.
